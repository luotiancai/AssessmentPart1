	abstract = {Modern water quality field sensors, probes, and sondes allow the collection of significant quantities of data
with high temporal resolution. These instruments can also collect high-resolution vertical profile data for multiple water
quality parameters. Until recently, regular collection of these large datasets has been rare; even more uncommon are tools
that can be used to analyze them. We developed a set of tools to import, store, and analyze vertical profile data and single
point measurements. We use Microsoft Excel to perform the initial data evaluation and processing, Microsoft Access as a
personal geodatabase, and ArcMap tools to analyze, visualize, and communicate the collected data. The ArcMap tools
provide vertical plots of multiple variables, spatial distributions of variables at a specific elevations or depths, and animations
of any of the data presentations over time. The tools also compute statistics and correlations among the variables from
quantitative analysis. The collected data are stored and referenced by location, time, depth, and elevation. The elevations are
interpolated to 0.25 foot elevations to allow spatial analysis of the data across monitoring points and through time. Vertical
profiles can be analyzed in various ways. For example, the profile at a monitoring point can be plotted over time, this can
show correlation among parameters, reservoir processes associated with depth such as thermal clines or oxygen deficient
areas, and other phenomenon. These data could be analyzed at multiple monitoring points at a single depth over time, for
example looking at spatial averages of selected depth measurements to analyze reservoir spatial processes such as the impact
of inflows or using simple time plots of parameters at a single monitoring point at selected depths. Data can also be analyzed
by elevation rather than depth since, for most reservoirs, significant depth fluctuations occur annually. Elevation, rather than
depth, can be important in some cases such as issues associated with a dam outlet elevation.},
